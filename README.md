# Introduction to Robotics (2023 - 2024)
Repository created for uploading (throughout the third year of faculty) the assignments from the 'Introduction to Robotics' course and laboratory, both held at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, part of University of Bucharest. Each homework will include requirements, implementation details, code and image files.

# Homework 1

Description of task:
  Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED: Red, Green, and Blue. This control must leverage digital electronics. Specifically, you need to read the potentiometerâ€™s value with Arduino and then write a mapped value to the LED pins.

Components used:
 - RGB LED x1
 - Potentiometers x3
 - Wires 
 - Breadboard x1
 - Resistance of 330 ohms x3
 - Arduino UNO x1
